echo The euro extended its gains above the $1.09 level, reaching its strongest point since mid-January, supported by broad dollar weakness after the US jobs data, coupled with somewhat dovish remarks by Fed Chair Powell, boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates by the middle of this year. In Europe, the ECB maintained borrowing costs at record highs, citing significant progress in curbing inflation despite persistent underlying price pressures and robust wage growth. Furthermore, it revised down its inflation expectations, projecting price growth of 2.3% for the year, before declining to 1.9% in 2025. During the press conference, ECB President Lagarde told journalists that policymakers did not discuss rate cuts for this meeting but hinted at the beginning of discussions regarding the relaxation of the bank's restrictive stance. She also emphasized that more evidence was necessary before considering rate cuts.
