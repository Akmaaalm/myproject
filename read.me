echo The dollar index extended losses to 102.5 on Friday, the lowest level since mid-January, as the latest jobs report showed the labour market is showing signs of cooling, reinforcing bets the Fed is close to starting cutting interest rates. The February payrolls figure came above forecasts but job gains in both January and December were revised sharply lower, the unemployment rate unexpectedly increased and wage growth slowed much more than anticipated. Investors are currently assigning a nearly 57% chance of a 25bps reduction in the fed funds rate in June. This week, Chair Powell told Congress the Fed still needs to become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably at 2% before cutting the rates, although it is not far from it. The biggest selling was against the yen, the British pound, and the Australian dollar. On the week, the greenback lost nearly 1.4%.
