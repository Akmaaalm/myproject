echo The dollar index extended losses to 102.5 on Friday, the lowest level since mid-January, as the latest jobs report showed the labour market is showing signs of cooling, reinforcing bets the Fed is close to starting cutting interest rates. The February payrolls figure came above forecasts but job gains in both January and December were revised sharply lower, the unemployment rate unexpectedly increased and wage growth slowed much more than anticipated. Investors are currently assigning a nearly 57% chance of a 25bps reduction in the fed funds rate in June. This week, Chair Powell told Congress the Fed still needs to become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably at 2% before cutting the rates, although it is not far from it. The biggest selling was against the yen, the British pound, and the Australian dollar. On the week, the greenback lost nearly 1.4%

echo The euro extended its gains above the $1.09 level, reaching its strongest point since mid-January, supported by broad dollar weakness after the US jobs data, coupled with somewhat dovish remarks by Fed Chair Powell, boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates by the middle of this year. In Europe, the ECB maintained borrowing costs at record highs, citing significant progress in curbing inflation despite persistent underlying price pressures and robust wage growth. Furthermore, it revised down its inflation expectations, projecting price growth of 2.3% for the year, before declining to 1.9% in 2025. During the press conference, ECB President Lagarde told journalists that policymakers did not discuss rate cuts for this meeting but hinted at the beginning of discussions regarding the relaxation of the bank's restrictive stance. She also emphasized that more evidence was necessary before considering rate cuts.
